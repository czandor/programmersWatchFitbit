# programmersWatchFitbit

Inspired by a clockface with the same name from Facer, made by user Lobby: https://www.facer.io/watchface/cUe0O8YjmA
I added more features:
- Wind speed
- BT connection info
- Heart rate icon
- Click on the bottom of the screen will show the binary code of the selected decimal value below
- INFO SCRIPT capability: The clockface can send a request to your script with some data in json format with raw POST, and it will display your script result under the DATE line. Info Script help: https://czandor.hu/fitbit/prog/info-help.php

Implemented features:
- Weather
- Health information


For weather, fill your OWM API key in /companion/weatherEnv.js file
